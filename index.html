                A web project today can take shape in an infinite amount of ways. Since it's initial deployment, web development has been subject to some of the 
                most mindblowing progressions. Whether they reflect efficiency or general capability, the progressions allow for almost anything to be done. From the slides presented we see some really cool examples
                ranging from unlimited scrolls to games or even AR. As long as it goes beyond the spectrum of immediate thought, what's created can be considered creative.

                I personally want to increase the web standard. I feel like there's so much that can be accomplished with the resources web developers now have, but for whatever reason a lot of websites
                continue to use their classic/dated templating.

                From this course I would love to be able to think a site and be able to build it. I'm sure that requires extensive practice, but I really do enjoy and appreciate this realm
                therefore I am more than willing to dedicate myself to becoming a talent in it.
